## Breakpoints
- `break <function/line>` -> set breakpoint at <function/line> in current file
- `break <file>:<function/line>` -> set breakpoint at <function/line> in <file>
- `delete breakpoints` -> deletes all breakpoints
- `delete breakpoints <breakpointNumber>` -> delete <breakpointNumber> breakpoint
- `info breakpoint` -> list all breakpoints and show comprehensive info
- `ignore <breakpointNumber> <count>` -> set <breakpointNumber> to be ignored for <count> times

## Data
- `set listsize <number>` -> changes listsize settings for `list` to display only <number> lines
- `set disassmbly-flavor <intel/att>` -> set the diassmebly style
- `show disassmbly-flavor` -> show current disassembly style

## Running
- `continue` -> run program till next interrupt(breakpoint, error etc.)

## Stack
- `backtrace/where/bt` -> print single backtrace of current frame(useful to find out where the program is currently at).
- `backtrace/where/bt -full` -> show entire backtrace of stack frames for current frame
- `backtrace/where/bt [COUNT]` ->
- `frame` -> shows current frame (useful for checking your location in file)

## Status
- `info <function/line>` -> show asm instruction address of <line> in current file
- `info <file>:<funciton/line>` -> show asm instruction address of <line> in <file>

## Support
- `quit/exit/q` -> exit GDB
